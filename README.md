# Format of the Image
This program is a program that determines the type of pictures. So with this program you can understand whether an image file is JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF or BMP.
Is not it enough to look at the extension to find out what kind of picture file it is? Never forget that there is no direct connection between file extensions and file formats.
So, file extensions are not a reliable method to understand the file format. Bring whichever extensions you bring to the end of an image file, that file is an image file.
This program will tell you what type of file it is, no matter what the extension of an image file is, even if it is not an extension of the file. It is enough to read the first few bytes of the file to understand what type of image file it is.
Within a few bytes of this image file you will find information about the nature of the file.
